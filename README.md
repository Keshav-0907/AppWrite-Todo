## Bug I Encountered 

While using Meilisearch, was able to run it succesfully on my device using docker on localhost:7700. I was able to make an index in meilisearch, but was unable to put data into that index. I was continiously getting "missing_document_id" code.

I also tried to debug this error using meilisearch documentation, but was unable to find anything that could solve this error
